**SFC Northwest**

Welcome to the Github Repository of SFC Northwest!
SFC or Student For Christ is a student arm of the Korean Presbyterian Church in America or KOSIN USA

Our mission statement is simple: "God Centered", "Bible Centered", "Church Centered".

This repository contains projects that SFC NW uses for our Campus Ministry and annual Summer Regional Conferences and (*potentially*) National Conferences.


Thanks for stopping by and welcome.
